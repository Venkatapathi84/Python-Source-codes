# Example: Fuzzy Relation in Python

# Define two sets: X = Cities, Y = Distances
X = ["CityA", "CityB", "CityC"]
Y = ["Near", "Far"]

# Define fuzzy relation as a dictionary
# Values are membership degrees between 0 and 1
fuzzy_relation = {
    ("CityA", "Near"): 1.0,
    ("CityA", "Far"): 0.0,
    ("CityB", "Near"): 0.6,
    ("CityB", "Far"): 0.4,
    ("CityC", "Near"): 0.2,
    ("CityC", "Far"): 0.8,
}

# Print fuzzy relation matrix
print("Fuzzy Relation Matrix (Cities Ã— Distance):\n")
print("       Near   Far")
for city in X:
    row = []
    for dist in Y:
        row.append(f"{fuzzy_relation[(city, dist)]:.2f}")
    print(f"{city:5}   {row[0]}   {row[1]}")




This fuzzy relation shows how close each city is:

CityA is fully "Near" (1.0) and not "Far" (0.0)

CityB is moderately near (0.6) and somewhat far (0.4)

CityC is more "Far" (0.8) than "Near" (0.2)
